# Arduino-VLC
This repository contains the code of my Deploma Theses which title is Visual Light Communications for Internet of Things applications

how to run:
each file should be in a separate folder with the same name
ex: folder: receiver6, file: receiver6.ino

intstall Arduino IDE from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
upload and run each program with the Arduino IDE to the trasnmmiter and receiver accordingly , launch each serial monitor and set baurd rate to 9600
then send your message

transmitter in the optical spectrum --> simple_transmitter.ino

receiver in the optical spectrum --> simple_receiver.ino

transmitter in the infrared spectrum --> transmitter_3.ino

receiver in the infrared spectrum --> receiver4.ino

transmitter with sync --> transmitter_comm.ino (final version)

receiver with sync --> receiver6.ino (final version)
